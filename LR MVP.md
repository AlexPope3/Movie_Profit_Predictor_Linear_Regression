The goal of this project is to find the best determinants of box office revenue, and how those determinants are related to one another.

To start exploring this goal, I created a pairplot which shows the linear relationship between the Target and the features. The results suggest that either World Gross Revenue or International Gross Revenue should be dropped as these features display collinearity. I plan to use runtime, release year, release month, and budget as my features.
